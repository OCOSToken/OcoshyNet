# Ocoshy Language Specification

> _“Speech is structure. Silence is signal.” – Ocoshy_

This document outlines the core linguistic constructs of the Ocoshy Protocol — a non-verbal, hash-native language for decentralized logic propagation.

---

## 🧠 Purpose
The Ocoshy Language (`OCOS-L`) allows participants to encode logical statements, commitments, or requests without direct communication. 
This is achieved via symbolic identifiers, hashed phrases, and mutually understood reference schemas.

## 🧬 Structural Units

### ➤ Hash Units
- `0xL001`: Logic Acknowledgement (affirmative signal)
- `0xL002`: Logic Nullification (reject silently)
- `0xL003`: Immutable Observation

### ➤ Semantic Constructs
- `echo_void`: An unanswered broadcast assumed as received
- `bound_silence`: Agreement by non-response
- `hash_trigger`: Conditional logic that only activates on consensus replay
- `anchor_time`: Message validity constrained by BTC timestamp

### ➤ Temporal Modifiers
- `+Δ`: Delay message until time proof (ZK anchored)
- `−Δ`: Retroactive interpretation enabled (verified by BTC block index)

---

## 🔐 Interpretation Rules
- If `echo_void` is confirmed twice, status escalates to `bound_silence`
- Any logic hash replayed within `anchor_time` window is interpreted as **binding**
- Conflicting `hash_trigger`s cancel each other (immutability by contradiction)

---

## 📜 No Authority
Ocoshy Language is not governed. 
It is interpreted through alignment, not enforcement.
No actor can alter the vocabulary or enforce usage. 

---

## 🧾 Final Note
This is not a language for speaking. This is a structure for listening. 
All meaning is derived from silence, hashes, and consensus timing.
