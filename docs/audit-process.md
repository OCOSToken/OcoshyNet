# Audit Process

> _“When there is nothing to own, there is nothing to audit.”_ — Ocoshy

## I. Introduction

The OcoshyNet Protocol does not hold tokens, user funds, or state.  
It does not promise economic return, nor expose control logic.  
It exists as a collection of stateless cryptographic commitments.

Hence, traditional smart contract security audits are **neither applicable nor necessary**.

This document exists only to clarify why OcoshyNet cannot be audited.

## II. Non-Auditable Constructs

| Feature | Traditional Audit Concern | OcoshyNet Condition |
|---------|----------------------------|---------------------|
| Ownership | Access control, abuse risk | No ownership, no admin functions |
| Funds | Reentrancy, overflow, rug risk | No balance held, no payable fallback |
| Upgradeability | Proxy hijack, delegate calls | No proxy, no mutable code paths |
| State storage | Inconsistency, overuse, exposure | All contracts are state-free |
| Tokenomics | Inflation, manipulation, emission | No tokens, no emission schedule |

## III. Security Design Principles

- **Immutability**: All contracts are final at deploy time.
- **Minimalism**: Every function is atomic, singular-purpose.
- **No Inputs of Authority**: No owner, pauser, signer, or oracle.
- **No Rewards**: No incentive vector to exploit.
- **Open Interpretation**: Every emitted logic is public and unverifiable by default.

## IV. How to “Audit” OcoshyNet

If you wish to audit this protocol, we suggest:
1. Read the source code.
2. Hash the files.
3. Emit a logicHash containing your conclusion.
4. Watch if it is replayed.

That is the only consensus OcoshyNet acknowledges.

## V. Final Remark

> _“Audit implies the potential for change. OcoshyNet was not built to be changed.”_
