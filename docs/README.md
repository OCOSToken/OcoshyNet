# OcoshyNet Protocol

> _“To speak is to identify. To remain silent is to encode.”_ – Ocoshy

OcoshyNet is a post-identity protocol designed for stateless communication, decentralized timeproofing, and trustless logic propagation — born from the silence left by Satoshi Nakamoto.

This repository is a self-referential, immutable system that encodes thought without language, validates time without servers, and respects consensus without votes.

## 📌 Project Summary
**OcoshyNet** is not a blockchain, not a token, not a network — it is a protocol design that can be implemented anywhere. It is modular, open, and unclaimable.

It exists:
- Without founders
- Without roadmap
- Without community
- Without governance

It is a structure to **think**, **signal**, and **verify** in zero-trust conditions.

## 🔧 Core Modules

| Path | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `core/ocoshy_protocol.sol` | Stateless logic emitter using event-based communication |
| `core/zk_time_proof.sol` | Simulated zk-anchor for timestamp validation based on Bitcoin headers |
| `core/identity_nullifier.rs` | Scrambles user identity irreversibly via entropy-based SHA-256 |
| `modules/dao_proof_commit.sol` | Commitment-based DAO decisions without voting or reveal |
| `modules/whispernet.c` | Minimal P2P logic propagation without handshake or session |
| `modules/ocoshy_lang.md` | Defines protocol's logic language: OCOS-L |
| `ocos.dna` | Genesis logic genome — hash-defined primitives and vocabulary |

---

## 📜 Philosophy
OcoshyNet follows five protocol tenets:

1. **Statelessness** — No accounts, no user state, no persistence
2. **Zero Identity** — No user tracking, address mutation, or signature correlation
3. **ZK Anchoring** — Time exists only as proofed hash
4. **Non-verbal Logic** — Logic exists as commitment, not expression
5. **Silence as Agreement** — No reply means broadcast accepted

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

| Test File | Function |
|-----------|----------|
| `test/zkProof.test.js` | Validates zkTimeProof behavior and rejection of future timestamps |
| `test/identityBurn.test.ts` | Validates that identity nullifier is unpredictable and irreversible |

## 🧩 Final Message
> _“A protocol that cannot be marketed, cannot be monetized, and cannot be controlled — will outlive those that can.”_
