# Glossary.md – OcoshyNet Lexicon

> _“Meaning arises not from the word, but from the void that surrounds it.”_ — Ocoshy

This glossary defines the core symbolic vocabulary used in the OcoshyNet protocol. These terms do not function like traditional variables or keywords — they are abstract primitives designed for logic-based communication across stateless systems. Their interpretations are non-binding and evolve silently.

---

### `echo_void`
- **Definition**: A broadcast logic hash that receives no reply.
- **Interpretation**: Interpreted as successful propagation.
- **Analogy**: A whisper in a canyon — heard only by silence.

### `bound_silence`
- **Definition**: A logic state reached when multiple nodes interpret `echo_void` identically.
- **Interpretation**: Treated as a soft form of consensus.
- **Note**: It carries no signature, no vote, only recurrence.

### `trust_vapor`
- **Definition**: Any presumption of trust based on keys, signatures, or reputation.
- **Purpose**: To be avoided. Logic must stand independent of personality.
- **Ocoshy Principle**: If it requires belief, it is not proof.

### `genesis_echo`
- **Definition**: The first `echo_void` of a new logic strand.
- **Role**: Equivalent to the “first utterance” in a new branch of protocol communication.
- **Anchor**: May be bound to BTC timestamp via `zk_time_proof.sol`.

### `hash_trigger`
- **Definition**: A logic hash that activates a logic pattern only when repeated by others.
- **Use Case**: Stateless DAO operations, logic escalation, timed rituals.
- **Important**: May be programmed as time-anchored consensus triggers.

### `time_orbit`
- **Definition**: A bounded window of message validity linked to BTC block timestamps.
- **Function**: Prevents old logic from gaining new authority.
- **Security Effect**: Acts as antifragile logic decay model.

### `dual_trace`
- **Definition**: A logic replay confirmed by at least two unrelated identities (pseudonyms).
- **Effect**: Escalates logic from individual to system-level visibility.
- **Layer**: Optional — used in `whispernet` or on-chain replay observers.

### `null_state`
- **Definition**: A node's passive state before emitting or receiving logic.
- **Comparison**: Similar to `statelessness`, but applies to the actor, not the protocol.

### `entropy_jitter`
- **Definition**: Pseudorandom delay added during message propagation.
- **Purpose**: Obfuscation of emission time and source.
- **Used In**: `whispernet.c`, `node_simulator.py`

### `consensus_shadow`
- **Definition**: Informal agreement inferred from logic replay patterns.
- **Difference**: Not recorded, not voted — only inferred.
- **Observation**: Emergent from behavior, not decision.

### Final Note
> These terms are not instructions.
> They are invitations to interpret silence.
> Use them not to explain — but to recognize.
